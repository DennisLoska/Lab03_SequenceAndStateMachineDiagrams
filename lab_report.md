## Part 1: Sequence Diagrams
**Assignment**

#### As a finger exercise for Sequence Diagrams, pick one of the following example projects from the first semester and draw a sequence diagram for the main use case:

 - The Clock Display / Use case: timeTick() is called
 - Auction / Use case: makeABid() is called
 - Tech Support / Use case: user command is entered (start() method in SupportSystem)
 - The Zuul Project / Use case: user enters command (method: play() in Game.java)

Von den obern gennanten Use Cases haben wir uns für **timeTick()** entschieden:

#### Now take your scenarios from the second exercise and have a good look at them. There are a number of processes that you should have detailed in your scenarios - if not, now you learn how to be thorough :) You need to draw sequence diagrams for the following use cases:

- Ordering a Pumpkin/Treat
- one other use case of your choosing

#### Ordering a Pumpkin/Treat

#### Registration at the HTW Shop
Neben dem Use Case "Ordering a Pumpkin/Treat" haben wir uns außerdem für ein Use Case entschieden, welches die Registrierung eines Users im HTW-Shop beschreibt.

## Part 2: State Machine Diagrams

#### Model the modified goat/cabbage/wolf problem: The farmer is in Schöneweide and wants to get his goat, his cabbage and his wolf over to Oberschöneweide. Only one thing can fit in his boat at a time beside himself. He cannot leave the cabbage and the goat or the goat and the wolf alone on the same side of the river, for obvious reasons. Is it possible for him to get all three possessions across the Spree? Draw a State Machine Diagram modelling both solutions to this problem.

#### Model the states an IMI student passes through from the first until the sixth semester. (Special prize for the most humorous model that is not offensive.)

#### Model the states of a parser that determines if a given string is a proper floating-point number.

#### Model the states a Pumpkin order in the HTW system can be in.
